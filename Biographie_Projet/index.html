        <h2>les dates clés et les meilleures réalisations :</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="date">1960 :</span> He won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1961 :</span> He became a Muslim after 1961.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1964 :</span> He won the world heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1964 :</span> On March 6, 1964, he announced that he no longer would be known as Cassius Clay but as Muhammad Ali.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1966 :</span> In 1966, Ali refused to be drafted into the military, citing his religious beliefs and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War. He was found guilty of draft evasion so he faced 5 years in prison and was stripped of his boxing titles.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1971 :</span> Overturned his conviction in 1971</li>
          <li><span class="date">1971 :</span> On March 8, 1971, Ali got his chance to regain his heavyweight crown against reigning champ Joe Frazier (1944-2011) in what was billed as the “Fight of the Century.”</li>
          <li><span class="date">1974 :</span> The October 30, 1974, fight in Kinshasa, Zaire, was dubbed the “Rumble in the Jungle.” Ali, the decided underdog, employed his “rope-a-dope” strategy, leaning on the ring ropes and absorbing a barrage of blows from Foreman while waiting for his opponent to tire. The strategy worked, and Ali won in an eighth-round knockout to regain the title stripped from him seven years prior.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1975 :</span> Ali successfully defended his title in 10 fights, including the memorable “Thrilla in Manila” on October 1, 1975, in which his bitter rival Frazier, his eyes swollen shut, was unable to answer the bell for the final round. Ali also defeated Norton in their third meeting in a unanimous 15-round decision.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1978 :</span> On February 15, 1978, an aging Ali lost his title to Leon Spinks (1953-) in a 15-round split decision. Seven months later, Ali defeated Spinks in a unanimous 15-round decision to reclaim the heavyweight crown and become the first fighter to win the world heavyweight boxing title three times.</li>
          <li><span class="date">1990 :</span> He met with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein (1937-2006) in 1990 to negotiate the release of American hostages.</li>
          <li><span class="date">2002 :</span> And in 2002 he traveled to Afghanistan as a United Nations Messenger of Peace.</li>
          <li><span class="date">2005 :</span> Ali was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a 2005 White House ceremony, and in the same year the $60 million Muhammad Ali Center, a nonprofit museum and cultural center focusing on peace and social responsibility, opened in Louisville.</li>
